written widely application real options particularly fields life sciences technology e business special interest relationship risk assessment validation risk data financial valuation would sum approach business decision analytics projects set help businesses face massive uncertainties kind decision analysis helps people explore problems redesign decision making process increase chance making right choices example imagine biotechnology company decide whether put sale enter strategic relationship continue go alone options lead value enhancing value destroying scenarios work client firstly understand challenge assumptions associated likely business development scenarios secondly help identify decisions would help protect increase value technology company quantifying technical regulatory commercial risks sometimes challenge technology intensive fields however found managers often scientists quite willing describe main sources risk assess probability risky event may may occur kind risky decision making relate real options valuation say value asset decide might use means form opinion value asset must explore important decisions likely face significant impact value asset decision analysis helps define business problem uncover stream inter related choices effect real options example company trying decide whether invest risky project option pull plug investment early stage pilot project gives poor showing real option reduces riskiness increases potential value original business plan real options decision analysis really close one another believe real options valuations find decision analysis useful mean often decision analysis help managers identify key risks strategic decision attach weights show clearly interact many companies risk discovery valuable

base calculation single discounted cashflow projected activity really take account way scenarios change fact managers react situations unfold mentioned earlier option kill project business early point upside pilot project yields exciting results might allow invest quickly reach revenue generating position much shorter time original business plan allows value future business really need look cashflows might arise number scenarios realistic project gets green light bet managers taking kind decision ground time challenging part mapping decision analysis tree modelling links variables
